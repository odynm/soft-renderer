# Software Renderer
This is my attempt to implement a simple software renderer, mainly to learn how one works (and to refine my C/C++ skills).

## Language
This project is writted using [Orthodox C++](https://gist.github.com/bkaradzic/2e39896bc7d8c34e042b).

## Build
Run **build.bat**. If you're lucky, that's it.
If not, you may need to locate your vsvars32.exe file somewhere in the Program Files folder (make sure the C++ Tools is installed on Visual Studio) and edit the build.bat file accordingly.
